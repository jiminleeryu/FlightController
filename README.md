# FlightController
The basic flight controller app created using Android Studio employs the Multiwii serial protocol to establish communication between the app and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This app serves as an intuitive interface that allows users to control and navigate the UAV using their Android device.

Through the app, users can input commands and preferences for the UAV's flight parameters, such as altitude, orientation, and movement. The app translates these user inputs into the Multiwii serial protocol, a standardized communication format commonly used in the field of drone control. This protocol includes commands for flight control, motor speed adjustments, and sensor data retrieval.

When the user interacts with the app by adjusting controls or entering flight commands, the app encodes these commands using the Multiwii protocol and sends them to the UAV's onboard flight controller through a serial connection. The UAV's flight controller interprets these commands and responds accordingly, resulting in the desired changes in the UAV's flight behavior.

By combining Android Studio, the Multiwii serial protocol, and an intuitive user interface, this flight controller app enables users to operate unmanned aerial vehicles with ease.
